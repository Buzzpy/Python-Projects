These scripts are written to run on Apify as actors (scrapers).

However, if you want to run them locally, please refer to the tutorials on Apify's blog under this page: [blog.apify.com/author/chenuli](https://blog.apify.com/author/chenuli/).

The first part of these tutorials is for local runs, and the scripts in this directory are for running on Apify Console.

If you have any questions, reach out to me at chenuli@devpedia.dev or buzzpy123@gmail.com.
