   About the role:
 
 
 
   As a Data Scientist Senior, you will:
 
 
 
   The Data Scientist Senior thrives when constructing complex solutions that integrate data wrangling, visualization, and advanced modeling techniques into a seamless workflow using software development best practices in R, Python, or other scripting languages. They are comfortable working with APIs, web scraping, and SQL/no-SQL databases. It is not uncommon for our Data Scientists to automate business workflows while integrating stochastic/numeric algorithms in the process. Creating and modifying predictive algorithms to uncover and answer business questions makes us tick. Our products are usually delivered as a scheduled deployment, markdown report, dashboard, shiny application, or API. In contrast to an Associate, the Senior will develop more autonomy to develop solutions and may lead others, take on administrative tasks, perform support roles, and get involved in new business development.
 
 
 
   Essential Job Functions
 
 
 
  Service Specialization: Develop service specific knowledge through greater exposure to peers, internal experts, clients, regular self-study, and formal training opportunities. Gain exposure to a variety of client situations to develop business skills. Retain knowledge gained and performance feedback provided to transfer into future work. Approach all problems and projects with a high level of professionalism, objectivity and an open mind to new ideas and solutions.
  Data Analysis: Participate and take ownership in the collection, analysis, and automated collection of data using a variety of data tools. Together with the Data Analytics team, support the building and implementing of models, algorithms, and simulations supporting solutions for external clients and internal projects. Assess the effectiveness and accuracy of new data sources and data gathering techniques.
  Data Development: Working under the guidance of a variety of Data Analytics team members, gain exposure to developing custom data models and algorithms to apply to data sets. Execute predictive and inferential analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence techniques. Use existing processes and tools to monitor and analyze solution performance and accuracy, and communicate findings to team members and end users.
  Collaboration: Work individually as well as in collaboration with others. Interaction with others will primarily be virtual with leadership and colleagues from other offices. Take on additional roles beyond technical development and client service that may include: serving as primary contact with clients or business leaders on internal projects, take on administrative tasks, perform support roles, and get involved in new business development.
 
 
 
   What you will need:
 
 
   2 to 5 years experience in data analytics, statistics, data science, financial consulting, computer science or related field.
   Data Science experience with focus on AI such as large language models, or computer vision
   Azure AI Product experience (Document Intelligence Studio, Azure AI Studio, Azure Co-Pilot Studio)

   About the Department
 
  The TMW Center for Early Learning + Public Health at the University of Chicago develops, tests, and implements evidence-based interventions designed to promote very young children’s cognitive and social-emotional development, with a priority placed on that of children living in poverty. TMW Center interventions are designed to be overlaid onto existing health, education, and social service systems working at scale in a given community in order to meet families where they already are. The TMW Center has a robust research and development strategy that includes further development and testing of TMW interventions; harnessing technology to support behavior change, intervention engagement, and analysis; and furthering strategies to engage parents in the TMW Center’s interventions across the health, early learning, and social service sectors.
 
   Job Summary
 
  The TMW Center for Early Learning + Public Health (TMW Center) develops science-based interventions, tools, and technologies to help parents and caregivers interact with young children in ways that maximize brain development. A rich language environment is critical to healthy brain development, however few tools exist to measure the quality or quantity of these environments. Access to this type of data allows caregivers to enhance interactions in real-time and gives policy-makers insight in how to best build policies that have a population-level impact.
  
  The wearable team within TMW Center is building a low-cost wearable device that can reliably and accurately measure a child’s early language environment vis-à-vis the conversational turns between a child and caregiver. The goal is to provide accurate, real-time feedback that empowers parents and caregivers to create the best language environment for their children.
  
  The TMW Center is looking for a Senior Data Scientist to support the wearable team in the development of this wearable technology. As a member of the TMW Center’s wearable team, the Data Science Analysts will develop, test, and validate existing machine learning algorithms, train new algorithms, lead ETL efforts, and partner with other team members and vendors to connect the algorithm, hardware and firmware pieces together. The TMW Center seeks candidates who are dynamic, collaborative, and curious.
  
  Candidates are encouraged to include a link to an online portfolio of work, such as a GitHub profile.

 <div>
  <br> About the Department
 </div>
 <br> The TMW Center for Early Learning + Public Health at the University of Chicago develops, tests, and implements evidence-based interventions designed to promote very young children&#x2019;s cognitive and social-emotional development, with a priority placed on that of children living in poverty. TMW Center interventions are designed to be overlaid onto existing health, education, and social service systems working at scale in a given community in order to meet families where they already are. The TMW Center has a robust research and development strategy that includes further development and testing of TMW interventions; harnessing technology to support behavior change, intervention engagement, and analysis; and furthering strategies to engage parents in the TMW Center&#x2019;s interventions across the health, early learning, and social service sectors.
 <div>
  <br> Job Summary
 </div>
 <br> The TMW Center for Early Learning + Public Health (TMW Center) develops science-based interventions, tools, and technologies to help parents and caregivers interact with young children in ways that maximize brain development. A rich language environment is critical to healthy brain development, however few tools exist to measure the quality or quantity of these environments. Access to this type of data allows caregivers to enhance interactions in real-time and gives policy-makers insight in how to best build policies that have a population-level impact.
 <br> 
 <br> The wearable team within TMW Center is building a low-cost wearable device that can reliably and accurately measure a child&#x2019;s early language environment vis-&#xe0;-vis the conversational turns between a child and caregiver. The goal is to provide accurate, real-time feedback that empowers parents and caregivers to create the best language environment for their children.
 <br> 
 <br> The TMW Center is looking for a Senior Data Scientist to support the wearable team in the development of this wearable technology. As a member of the TMW Center&#x2019;s wearable team, the Data Science Analysts will develop, test, and validate existing machine learning algorithms, train new algorithms, lead ETL efforts, and partner with other team members and vendors to connect the algorithm, hardware and firmware pieces together. The TMW Center seeks candidates who are dynamic, collaborative, and curious.
 <br> 
 <br> Candidates are encouraged to include a link to an online portfolio of work, such as a GitHub profile.

   About the Department
 
  The Lindau Laboratory at The University of Chicago is an interdisciplinary, team-based laboratory performing human-level observational, interventional, and health services research motivated by a fundamental concern for the principle of justice in health and health care. The lab, funded predominantly by agencies of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for more than 15 years, employs about 20 full and part-time researchers and staff across disciplines including epidemiology, gerontology, anthropology, neurobiology, cancer biology, public health, and data science. The lab routinely collaborates across disciplines, departments, and with investigators at other institutions including experts in the fields of computer science, geriatrics, oncology, public health, social services administration, psychology, neuroscience, materials science, engineering and other medical and social science fields. The work of the lab focuses in two main areas: 1) preservation and treatment of female sexual function in the context of aging, cancer and other common diseases and 2) social determinants of health, with a particular concern for women and older adults living in socioeconomically marginalized communities. Our research and programmatic activities include Bionic Breast, WomanLab, Feed1st and CommunityRx. The Lab has spun out two companies: Now Pow, LLC (acquired by Unite USA, Inc. in 2021) and MAPSCorps, 501c3 (joined Northwestern University School of Education and Social Policy in 2023), both originally headquartered in Hyde Park, Chicago, IL.

"Recruiting From Scratch","Recruiting from Scratch is a 100% remote talent agency that connects exceptional people to top companies. We represent clients globally - from new startups to large enterprises - and help them find the best talent possible for engineering, product, design, accounting, GTM, sales, marketing and senior leadership roles. As of 2023, half of our candidates received offers within 21.5 days from their first interview (compared to the industry average of 49 days for engineering positions according to LinkedIn).","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/128x128/6eee5154be60112c9992f06fcbe2e4f9","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Recruiting-From-Scratch","4","1","https://www.recruitingfromscratch.com","Who is Recruiting from Scratch : 
 
 
  Recruiting from Scratch is a talent firm that focuses on placing the best candidate for our clients. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the North America, South America, and Europe to help them hire.
   Our client is dedicated to speeding up the pace of innovation at manufacturing companies, by automating the identification of regulations for any product. They are seed round.
   Their Mission
   They are building an AI/LLM platform to accelerate product development at manufacturing companies. They do that by creating NLP pipelines that identify all regulations that are relevant to any product in development, such as an electric battery or the latest level-4 autonomous driving system. As engineers, reading complex legal and regulatory documents are often the last things we want to do. What we’re building means that teams will never have to pore over 1000-page PDFs via Google Translate ever again, and can instead focus entirely on building the best systems that the world needs today. 
  In short, what you build with us will directly lead to companies launching physical products months faster than before. 
  Our Culture
   Our mission starts with us. To build a transformation product, we need to feel supported, intellectually challenged, and above all surrounded by kind, team-oriented colleagues. 
  
   Our mental and physical health comes first. We encourage our team to take time off when needed, and trust that we will too. 
   We value ownership, creativity, camaraderie, vulnerability, and transparency. We celebrate wins and face challenges head-on. 
   Diversity, equity, and inclusion is at our core. We’re committed to hiring and retaining talent from underrepresented folks in tech and outside of tech. 
  
  Overview of Role
   The ideal candidate has a deep LLM/NLP background paired with a strong backend skillset, and has experience iterating quickly in a startup environment. You are ready to work with new technologies and learn whatever is needed to solve the challenges we will face. You will have complete, end-to-end ownership of our core models—working closely with our data engineers and iterating with our customers. Depending on your interest, this role can be an IC or have a team built around it. If you aspire to be an entrepreneur or an engineering leader, this role is for you. 
  They are hybrid, and based out of NYC. If you are not currently in NYC, we would ask you to plan to move to the city in the next few months. 
  Responsibilities
  
    Collaborate closely with founding team members to translate product strategy into iterative, scalable product/model versions that can be rapidly deployed for user testing 
   Lead the team in selecting the appropriate technology stack, framework, and tools to enable experimentation, testing, and tracking 
   Own the architecture and development of the working product/models and beyond 
   Strategize and articulate tradeoffs between speed and scalability 
  
  Qualifications
  
    Bachelors or Masters in Computer Science, Engineering, or other related field 
   3+ years of professional experience 
   A highly analytical approach and proven ability to solve technical problems with ML, NLP, and LLMs (commercial, open-source, and proprietary) 
   Product-oriented and comfortable working in a dynamic environment with evolving objectives and fast iteration with users 
   Strong backend skillset with experience building production systems, beyond just a proof-of-concept 
   Expertise in programming languages (e.g., Python), experience with ML/NLP frameworks (e.g., LangChain, TensorFlow, PyTorch, BERT), and experience working with various LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Llama, Mistral) 
   Excellent communication skills and low ego 
   US work authorization is required; we do not currently support visa transfers 
  
  Nice to haves
  
    Experience with cloud service providers (e.g., AWS), and IIAC (Terraform, Cloudformation)

Tempus' proprietary platform connects an entire ecosystem of real-world evidence to deliver real-time, actionable insights to physicians, providing critical information about the right treatments for the right patients, at the right time. 
  We are seeking an experienced scientist to lead Computational Discovery Science at Tempus. This scientist will be responsible for building a team and platform focused on identifying novel targets for cancer therapeutics. This role will be at the forefront of developing and applying computational methods for drug discovery using Tempus' large clinico-genomic database, as well as functional and molecular assays - single cell, spatial, and functional genomics - applied to patient-derived organoids. This role demands a blend of creative and strategic thinking, leadership skills, and a passion for groundbreaking research.

   In partnership with Tempus' modeling lab, use data from CRISPR and cell perturbation experiments in patient-derived organoids to identify and validate novel targets 
   Develop and implement scientific strategies and experimental work plans, including identifying new methodologies and approaches for large clinicogenomic databases and PDOs 
   Integrate the above to prioritize target opportunities matched to biomarker and indication strategies that enhance likelihood of developmental success. 
   
 
 MANAGERIAL: 
  
  
   Mentor and project manage a team of junior scientists or technicians to deliver on the project goals and objectives 
   
 
 COLLABORATION:

   Job Description: Lead React Developer, Front Office Analytics Sr. Engineer

 <div>
   Who We Are
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
   Built from the ground up to directly support front office services for our clients, the Front Office Analytics (FOA) team sits within Northern Trust&#x2019; Asset Servicing. We are staffed to operate as an extension of our clients&#x2019; business much like technical experts that are typically attached to the front office operations of the trading desk. Offering both outsourced services and collaborative problem solving as client and market needs change, this team is built to be creative, flexible, and most importantly, tactical.

 </div>

 <div>
   Our mission is to deliver a true front office analytics service, providing clients with comprehensive and highly dynamic oversight of total portfolio exposures, risk, performance, regulatory, and portfolio compliance monitoring. This allows clients to spend more time developing insights and making informed investment decisions, and less time managing data. We achieve this through empowering a client-focused team of subject matter experts with a purpose-built technology stack that allows for extensive and scalable client customization. The ability to deliver customized total portfolio analytics at scale allows the service to truly operate as an extension of our clients&#x2019; business.

"MedSpeed","It all started in 1999, when MedSpeed’s founder, Jake Crampton, sought to disrupt the transactional medical courier marketplace with an innovative, smarter solution. From a business plan developed in graduate school, to a national operation with more than 100 launch points in 28 states, MedSpeed is a unique and exciting organization.

Our mission, vision, purpose and culture demonstrate how MedSpeeders view at the world and the expectations we have for our team and interactions with our clients.","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/128x128/0648451dc6ee33937c39421e37b3c0e2","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Medspeed","3.2","520","http://www.medspeed.com","Data Scientist

"Adler Planetarium",,,"https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Adler-Planetarium","3.7","46","https://www.adlerplanetarium.org","Far Horizons Data Science Postdoctoral Fellow
 
 
   Full Time
 
 
 
   About the Adler Planetarium
 
 
 
   The Adler Planetarium connects people to the universe and each other. Whether it is introducing a guest to the Ring Nebula, a neighborhood school to a community partner, a research team to a network of citizen scientists, or one staff member to another, Adler’s focus on meaningful connections dates back nearly a century.
 
 
 
   Today, the museum hosts more than half a million visitors each year and reaches millions more through youth STEM programs, neighborhood skywatching events, online citizen science, and other outreach projects. With Adler’s support, people of all ages, backgrounds, and abilities gain the confidence to explore their universe together and return to their communities ready to think critically and creatively about any challenge that comes their way.
 
 
 
   The Position
 
 
   The Science Engagement Division at the Adler Planetarium (Adler) is seeking candidates for a Postdoctoral Fellowship position in the field of Data Science, with an emphasis on Remote Sensing and Geospatial Analysis. The Postdoctoral Fellow will carry out independent research with a focus on the analysis of light pollution image data collected by the Adler’s Far Horizons research program.
 
 
 
   The Far Horizons program is currently doing fieldwork using two main instrument sets designed and built at the Adler: the GONet camera system, which collects all-sky nighttime environment data in the field, and the NITELite system, which is a high-altitude balloon-borne camera system that collects regional scale night-time images from the stratosphere.
 
 
 
   These instruments are being used to help characterize and quantify the effect of nighttime light on the environment. Recent results have included a large-scale distributed transect experiment with 19 GONet cameras across 140 km to map the extended skyglow of Chicago. Data collected from NITELite missions over Indianapolis, Indiana are being used to characterize light emission by land use as well as explore the effects of light at night on urban ecological systems. Recent examples of research partnerships include the National Park Service, UCLA, Butler University, and the European Space Agency funded NEOMI project.
 
 
 
   In collaboration with Far Horizons staff and volunteers, the Postdoctoral Fellow will be responsible for:
 
 
 
  
   
     Pursuing an independent light pollution-focused research program.
   
  
   
     Developing and maintaining data pipelines to process raw images from the NITELite and GONet systems into a calibrated, georeferenced, indexed dataset.
   
  
   
     Creating tools to generate data products of interest from the NITELite and GONet datasets, such as
   
   
    
     
       calibrated image mosaics for geospatial analysis
     
    
     
       time-dependent features of light emission from image data
     
   
  
   
     Applying advanced data analysis techniques (e.g., machine learning, image processing, etc.) where relevant to research goals
   
  
   
     Collaborating with and learning from Far Horizons DevOps volunteers to ensure the toolset meets tech-industry standards (inc. containerization, AWS deployments, etc.)
   
  
   
     Mentoring undergraduate interns and high-school students in research
   
  
   
     Assisting Teen Program experts in the development of Far Horizons student-facing programs
   
 
 
 
   Although preferred, prior experience in the field of light pollution research is not required.
 
 
 
   The Postdoctoral Fellow responsibilities will be divided approximately 70% to research and 30% to outreach. The 30% outreach portion of this position will involve mentoring students in research and assisting our Teen Program experts in the development of student-facing programs built on Far Horizons content. Through the Adler’s Far Horizons program, we engage teens, undergraduate students, and adults in high-altitude balloon experiments, engineering, design, research, and complex image processing and data analysis. Far Horizons research is the foundation of our student STEM programming. As an example of the outcomes of these efforts, our teens recently helped establish the world’s largest Urban Night Sky Place through a partnership with the Forest Preserves of Cook County.
 
 
 
   The Postdoctoral Fellowship will be for a three-year term starting in September 2023, though open to an earlier start date. The position comes with research support and a competitive benefits package including:

 <div>
  <b><br> The Position</b>
 </div>
 <div>
   The Science Engagement Division at the Adler Planetarium (Adler) is seeking candidates for a Postdoctoral Fellowship position in the field of Data Science, with an emphasis on Remote Sensing and Geospatial Analysis. The Postdoctoral Fellow will carry out independent research with a focus on the analysis of light pollution image data collected by the Adler&#x2019;s Far Horizons research program.
 </div>
 <p></p>
 <div>
  <br> The Far Horizons program is currently doing fieldwork using two main instrument sets designed and built at the Adler: the GONet camera system, which collects all-sky nighttime environment data in the field, and the NITELite system, which is a high-altitude balloon-borne camera system that collects regional scale night-time images from the stratosphere.
 </div>
 <p></p>
 <div>
  <br> These instruments are being used to help characterize and quantify the effect of nighttime light on the environment. Recent results have included a large-scale distributed transect experiment with 19 GONet cameras across 140 km to map the extended skyglow of Chicago. Data collected from NITELite missions over Indianapolis, Indiana are being used to characterize light emission by land use as well as explore the effects of light at night on urban ecological systems. Recent examples of research partnerships include the National Park Service, UCLA, Butler University, and the European Space Agency funded NEOMI project.
 </div>
 <p></p>
 <div>
  <br> In collaboration with Far Horizons staff and volunteers, the Postdoctoral Fellow will be responsible for:
 </div>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <div>
    <br> Pursuing an independent light pollution-focused research program.
   </div></li>
  <li>
   <div>
     Developing and maintaining data pipelines to process raw images from the NITELite and GONet systems into a calibrated, georeferenced, indexed dataset.
   </div></li>
  <li>
   <div>
     Creating tools to generate data products of interest from the NITELite and GONet datasets, such as
   </div>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <div>
       calibrated image mosaics for geospatial analysis
     </div></li>
    <li>
     <div>
       time-dependent features of light emission from image data
     </div></li>
   </ul></li>
  <li>
   <div>
     Applying advanced data analysis techniques (e.g., machine learning, image processing, etc.) where relevant to research goals
   </div></li>
  <li>
   <div>
     Collaborating with and learning from Far Horizons DevOps volunteers to ensure the toolset meets tech-industry standards (inc. containerization, AWS deployments, etc.)
   </div></li>
  <li>
   <div>
     Mentoring undergraduate interns and high-school students in research
   </div></li>
  <li>
   <div>
     Assisting Teen Program experts in the development of Far Horizons student-facing programs
   </div></li>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <div>
  <br> Although preferred, prior experience in the field of light pollution research is not required.
 </div>
 <p></p>
 <div>
  <br> The Postdoctoral Fellow responsibilities will be divided approximately 70% to research and 30% to outreach. The 30% outreach portion of this position will involve mentoring students in research and assisting our Teen Program experts in the development of student-facing programs built on Far Horizons content. Through the Adler&#x2019;s Far Horizons program, we engage teens, undergraduate students, and adults in high-altitude balloon experiments, engineering, design, research, and complex image processing and data analysis. Far Horizons research is the foundation of our student STEM programming. As an example of the outcomes of these efforts, our teens recently helped establish the world&#x2019;s largest Urban Night Sky Place through a partnership with the Forest Preserves of Cook County.
 </div>
 <p></p>
 <div>
  <br> The Postdoctoral Fellowship will be for a three-year term starting in September 2023, though open to an earlier start date. The position comes with research support and a competitive benefits package including:

The groundwork has been established for another century of superior legal work and client service.

Philosophy

Our Firm seeks long-term, partnering relationships with clients, to the end of providing the best total solution to the client's legal needs.

We manage our Firm as an integrated whole. Approximately 2,900 lawyers in varying practice areas work together as multidisciplinary teams to provide the full-service capabilities our clients need for the legal matters they retain Kirkland to handle.

Kirkland's open assignment system allows each attorney to choose the practice areas and matters on which they work. This entrepreneurial approach yields higher levels of commitment, morale and results in all of our core practices.

Diversity

At Kirkland, we believe that our ability to function at the very highest level of our profession is significantly enhanced by building a team of lawyers who bring us the benefits of a broad range of socioeconomic, racial, ethnic and personal backgrounds.

Kirkland is a strong and dynamic institution with a strategic network of offices located in major business centers around the globe. In line with our strategy of sensible, organic growth, the Firm has expanded geographically to meet the needs of our clients while maintaining a strong focus on quality control.

Community Service

Our Firm is committed to serving the communities in which we practice and live. Through pro bono work, our lawyers make their skills and talents available to those who cannot afford legal representation. They provide pro bono clients with the same commitment and diligence they show for our traditional clients. The Kirkland & Ellis Foundation provides financial support to charitable and law-related organizations that enhance communities through emergency relief, legal assistance, community services, sustainability/conservation efforts, cultural awareness, youth programs, health care initiatives, education opportunities and diversity sensitivity.

Diversity

At Kirkland, we believe that our ability to function at the very highest level of our profession is significantly enhanced by building a team of lawyers who bring us the benefits of a broad range of socioeconomic, racial, ethnic and personal backgrounds.

Through pro bono work, our lawyers make their skills and talents available to those who cannot afford legal representation. They provide pro bono clients with the same commitment and diligence they show for our traditional clients. The Kirkland & Ellis Foundation provides financial support to charitable and law-related organizations that enhance communities through emergency relief, legal assistance, community services, sustainability/conservation efforts, cultural awareness, youth programs, health care initiatives, education opportunities and diversity sensitivity.

"Kirkland and Ellis","For more than 100 years, Kirkland has provided exceptional service to clients around the world in complex litigation, corporate and tax, intellectual property, restructuring and counseling matters. The groundwork has been established for another century of superior legal work and client service.

Philosophy

Kirkland's principal goals are to provide the highest quality legal services available anywhere; to be an instrumental part of each client's success; and to recruit, retain and advance the brightest legal talent. Our Firm seeks long-term, partnering relationships with clients, to the end of providing the best total solution to the client's legal needs.

Practice Areas

We manage our Firm as an integrated whole. Approximately 2,900 lawyers in varying practice areas work together as multidisciplinary teams to provide the full-service capabilities our clients need for the legal matters they retain Kirkland to handle.

Kirkland's open assignment system allows each attorney to choose the practice areas and matters on which they work. This entrepreneurial approach yields higher levels of commitment, morale and results in all of our core practices.

Diversity

At Kirkland, we believe that our ability to function at the very highest level of our profession is significantly enhanced by building a team of lawyers who bring us the benefits of a broad range of socioeconomic, racial, ethnic and personal backgrounds. Our commitment to diversity is reflected not only in the Firm's policies, programs and committees, but also through our efforts to build and maintain a culture that values and gathers strength from difference.

Geographic Reach

Kirkland is a strong and dynamic institution with a strategic network of offices located in major business centers around the globe. In line with our strategy of sensible, organic growth, the Firm has expanded geographically to meet the needs of our clients while maintaining a strong focus on quality control.

Community Service

Our Firm is committed to serving the communities in which we practice and live. Through pro bono work, our lawyers make their skills and talents available to those who cannot afford legal representation. They provide pro bono clients with the same commitment and diligence they show for our traditional clients. The Kirkland & Ellis Foundation provides financial support to charitable and law-related organizations that enhance communities through emergency relief, legal assistance, community services, sustainability/conservation efforts, cultural awareness, youth programs, health care initiatives, education opportunities and diversity sensitivity.

Technology & Support Services

The Firm makes extensive use of legal and administrative personnel to provide the appropriate skill level for the legal services required by our clients. Kirkland keeps pace with today's technology by providing our lawyers, staff and clients with the most advanced technology tools available to facilitate the practice of law.","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/128x128/0f59c4401abdcf67ba4b06490c1b7299","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Kirkland-&-Ellis-7","3.9","139","http://www.kirkland.com","About Kirkland & Ellis

We're looking for trailblazers with an entrepreneurial mindset to innovate, tinker and craft something entirely new from the ground up. 
  Within our team, you'll tackle high-impact projects that all revolve around understanding our client's customers. These include developing shopper recognition, attribution, and profiling products.

  What you'll do 
  You will be responsible for building and interpreting algorithms that power data products at Adyen. In this role, you will: 
  
  Obtain insights by leveraging machine learning algorithms. Examples are: Clustering algorithms to group customers/shoppers, supervised and semi-supervised learning methods for inference on shopper behavior or graph analysis and representation learning for behavior prediction and monitoring.

  You can communicate complex outcomes with clarity over a wide range of audiences. 
  Technologies: Extensive knowledge of data science and statistics techniques, toolsets and algorithms, such as e.g. Spark, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost, Pandas, Airflow, SQL.
